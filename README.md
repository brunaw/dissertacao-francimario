Unit Data: Probability Distributions in the Unit Interval
========================================

This repository contains a Shiny Application for the study 
and use of probability distributions for data on the unit interval 
(0, 1). The application was built with special help of the 
`flexdashboard` package and is still under development. 

On this application we built you will find some 
interesting tools:

  1. The first section is dedicated to the description, 
  mathematical properties and bibliography about each
  probability distribution; 

  2. The second section can be used for the study of how the form
  ("shape") of the distributions behave when we change the parameters. 
  This is important when we want to have a better visual 
  notion about the distribution;
  
  3. The third section we can say is the most important 
  one. Here, it is possible to see the distributions in action:

  * one dataset of data in the unit interval is available for
  demonstration. In this section, the chart of each variable 
  can be obtained, along with the results of the fits for all 
  the distributions for them, such as parameters and curves.
  For the understanding of which of the distributions is better
  for each variable, some estimators of the quality of 
  the models are presented, as the BIC and AIC. 
  
  * as a second option, the user himself can upload his own
  dataset and see how the distributions behave for it.
